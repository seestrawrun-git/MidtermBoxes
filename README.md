Thank you Brooks and CJ for the help!

Notes:

This isn't exactly what I outlined in my intial proposal, but I wanted to actually be able to accomplish some collision and interaction between the objects in my scene.  I've long struggled with trying to calculate distance in conditional statements to change the object's states.  After following along with this and coding it myself, I think I have a much better grasp on coding!
